hi, I am student of jboss community. So I visited coding blocks in Noida and there I sat in a classroom with my brother and after some time our teacher came in, so he start teaching us in a polite way by asking name and telling about coding that coding is used in different ways and in different works like - projects,music,games etc. He also told us about google Code-In that it is easy to learn and making our account in gitter. He also tell us about task to do and awards that we will get.In the break time we went outside and bought chips and cold - drink to eat . Jboss has helped me in learning coding and to know that google is not only a search engine it more than that and google Code - In is platform where I can show my talent and win awards.There were times when I had fun and there were times when I was confused but the journey with jboss is a great memory.The time which I spent with jboss is memory that will cherish forever .MY JOURNEY WITH JBOSS WAS AMAZING !!!!
